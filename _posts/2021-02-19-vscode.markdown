In this tutorial, you’ll enable the Remote-SSH plugin, configure Visual Studio Code to execute code on the remote server, and execute code from your local Visual Studio Code installation on the remote server.

<h1>{{ "Step 1 - Installing the Remote-SSH Plugin in Visual Code" }}</h1>
Go to Extension Marketplace by pressing `Ctrl+Shift+X` or by clicking on the bottom icon, which looks like four squares in a box.

{: refdef}

Once you have the Extensions Marketplace open, type `Remote-SSH` in the Search Extensions in Marketplace search bar. When you find the plugin, select it and then click the green Install button to install the extension.

<h1>{{ "Step 2 - Configuring the Remote-SSH Plugin and Connecting To Your Server" }}</h1>
For configuration, you'll need the following pieces of information:

* The server's IP or hostname.
* The username you'll connect with. 
* The private key you'll use for authentication.

You’ll use this information to create an SSH configuration file.

Now that you have the Remote-SSH plugin installed, you’ll see a small green box in the bottom left-hand corner of the Visual Studio Code interface. If you hover over the box with your mouse pointer, the popup will say <B>Open a remote window</B>. The button looks like a greater than sign slightly under a less than sign <B>>< </B>, like the one in the following image:

{:refdef: style="text-align: center;"}
![image-title-here](/assets/p3.png){:class="img-responsive"}
{: refdef}

Click the button, and a dialog box appears in the top center. Select <B>Remote-SSH: Open Configuration File… </B>from the list:

{:refdef: style="text-align: center;"}
![image-title-here](/assets/p4.png){:class="img-responsive"}
{: refdef}

The next prompt will ask you which configuration file you want to open. If you’re on Windows, you’ll see two locations: one in your personal user directory, and one in the installation location for SSH. You should use the file in your user directory when configuring the server.

Add the following code to the Config file:
{% highlight shell %}
Host server_hogwarts
    HostName 10.2.34.15
    User mayank.garg
    IdentityFile ~/.ssh/my_ssh_key
{% endhighlight %}

Visual Code is now configured and ready to connect to your server. Click on the green <B>Open a remote window</B> button in the bottom left-hand corner and select <B>Remote-SSH: Connect to Host…</B>

Enter password or passphrase to connect to your server.
